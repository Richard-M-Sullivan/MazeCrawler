// the command parser will have the state loaded or not loaded. This means that it has or doesn't have a
// tree of commands. To check if it is loaded or not you will need to call the loaded function.

// To load the tree you have to use the load command. This will require you to add a file, and the result will
// be that the data-structure is built and saved for use.

// Once the tree is loaded you can use the parse command function. This will take in a command and will return an
// dictionary of [{action:"action", noun:"noun"},{action:"action",noun:"noun"} ...]; this could be an array that is
// one item long or any number of items long. if there are no things to be returned, then it will return null.

// the way that the parser will work is that it will have a queue for actions. An action is essentially a command like
// move, take, drop, look... etc. It will have a queue for nouns. A noun is the thing that is passed to the command
// so that the action knows what to act on. It will have a field for whether or not a tree is loaded. It will also
// have a mutable tree data-structure that will keep track of all the keywords that are commands. This tree structure
// will be able to be created from scratch, have items removed, have items edited, have items added, and be able to 
// parse commands.
